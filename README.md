# Simple physics engine (SPE) 2D
## The ultimate learning playground => Maths, Physics and Rust programming
Will try to apply my physics skills from swedish gymnasiet course Fysik-2
To build an 2D physics engine (Simulation- next step as i haven't done graphics in rust yet)

### ONGOING and not meant as an production crate
It's my learning playground to learn Rust and physics engine design & graphics rendering (simulation)
Simply don't have any expections of goodness in this project, it's probably a piece of junk haha

## TODO:
- [ ] Add units and prefixes
- [ ] Make the programm calculate SHM params, based on initial conditions t=0 
- [x] Calculator style SHM- simple haromonic motion. Pendelum and springs 
- [ ] Learn how to draw stuff on the screen haha. might use an game engine like piston, ggez or graphics library like wgpu?

## Goals
* just to have fun in spare time besides monotone pen and paper assignments
* learn Rust and to become an Rustacean  in the process :)
* learn how good rust is for math based applications (as I have heared that maths crates are not mature enough, 
relative to c++, that maybe is not true anymore)
* learn about graphics rendering 
* learn rust conccurency and multithearding, for high speeeeeed computation
* get better understanding of simple physic concepts, that I learn in school
