# Simple physics engine (SPE) 2D
Will try to do apply my physics skills from swedish gymnasiet course Fysik-2
To build an 2D physics engine (Simulation- next step as i haven't done graphics in rust yet)

I will go in the same pace as my course goes

## TODO:
- [ ] Calculator style SHM- simple haromonic motion. Pendelum and springs 
- [ ] Learn how to draw stuff on the screen haha. might use an game engine like piston, ggez or graphics library like wgpu?

## Goals
* just to have fun in spare time besides monotone pen and paper assignments
* learn Rust and to become an Rustacean  in the process :)
* learn how good rust is for math based applications (as I have heared that maths crates are not mature enough, 
relative to c++, that maybe is not true anymore)
* learn about graphics rendering 
* learn rust conccurency and multithearding, for high speeeeeed computation
* get deeper understanding of simple physics concepts, that I learn in school

### ONGOING and not meant as an production crate
It's my learning playground to learn Rust and engine design & graphics rendering
